Unlike traditional banking systems that rely on a central authority (such as a bank or government), blockchain operates on a distributed network of computers.

Moreover, users remain in possession of their money all the time, there are no intermediaries to have a say in what they can do with it."),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Security: Blockchain uses advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data. Each transaction is recorded in a block, which is linked to the previous block using cryptographic hashes, creating an immutable chain. This makes it extremely difficult for malicious actors to tamper with the data or manipulate transactions. Additionally, blockchain's consensus mechanisms (such as proof of work or proof of stake) further enhance security by ensuring that transactions are verified and validated by multiple participants."),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Transparency and Audibility: Blockchain provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which can be accessed and verified by anyone. This transparency increases trust among participants and reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation.
