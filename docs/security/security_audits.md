# Security and Audit Reports

Ensuring the security of a blockchain platform is critical, especially when it's being used for important financial transactions and data storage. At eCredits, we prioritize the security of our users and their transactions. As a result, we conduct regular security assessments of our platform. 

## eCredits Security Audits

- **eCredits eVault Audit**: [eVault](/docs/consumers/evault.md) allows users to deposit eCredits and get rewarded. The eVault smart contracts have been audited by [Nethermind](https://nethermind.io/). You can find the full Report here: [eCredits eVault Audit Report](/files/2023_eVault_review_nethermind.pdf)

## Relevant Security Reports from Ethereum's Geth Client

As eCredits uses the Go Ethereum (Geth) client, which has undergone numerous security assessments and audits, the security properties of Geth also apply to eCredits. Ethereum also runs a bug bounty program which you can find at <https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty/>.
