## Setup App and Portal
The wallet App and the eCredits Portal are the entries to the eCredits Ecosystem, no matter what role you would like to have. As such we first need to setup both.

### Create an account in the app
To get started with the eWallet App, you must create an account. Follow the steps below to set up your account.

1. Access the eWallet App: Open the eWallet App on your mobile device. If you don't have the app installed, you can download it [here](https://link.ecredits.com/app/install).
2. Tap "Sign up"
3. Enter a username and password and tap again on "Sign up" and accept the terms and conditions
4. You'll receive an email to the address provided that you need to confirm in order to use your newly created account.
5. Once your Account has been created, you'll be guided through the setup process of your wallet account.
6. During the process please make sure to backup you Seed Phrase in a secure, but recoverable way. If you lose it, you'll be unable to access this wallet again!
7. After you have confirmed that you know your Seed Phrase, you can customize your profile to complete the setup procedure.

To enhance the security of your account, consider enabling additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication or a PIN code.
A more detailed version of this setup procedure can be found on the [support portal](https://support.ecredits.com/en/support/solutions/articles/66000496773-creating-an-account-with-the-ewallet-app).

Congratulations! You have successfully created an account with the eWallet App. Enjoy the convenience and features it offers for managing your finances securely.

### Setup the Portal

1. In order to sign up, switch to the "Register" tab, enter your email and password and accept the terms and conditions.
2. You'll receive an email to the address provided that you must confirm in order to use your newly-created account.
3. You can now choose if you want to create a Consumer or Merchant profile as first profile in your account.
4. When choosing Consumer, the next step is the app and wallet setup on the mobile app as described above.

Once you've successfully registered, a personal profile is already created for you.
