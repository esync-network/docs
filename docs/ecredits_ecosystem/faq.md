## How to work with multisig 
Multi-signature wallets or “multisig wallets” for short, are a type of cryptocurrency wallet for which at least two private keys are needed to sign a transaction.  

Imagine a secure locker with two locks and two keys held by two parties that can only be opened if both provide their keys, thus ensuring that one party is not able to open the box without the other party’s permission. 

See this in-depth guide on how to set up multisig:

## How to use metamask + ledger 
Currently, the eCredits Blockchain is not integrated into any ledger device.  
Since the eCredits Blockchain is built on the Ethereum Blockchain, using ETH works just as well. 

The only downside is that your ECS funds are not shown in the ledger itself. 
To be able to use a ledger and see your ECS funds, you must:  

1. Set up the ledger device and choose Ethereum as the blockchain  
2. Import the hardware wallet into Metamask  

Even though you don’t see your ECS in the ledger, if you import it into Metamask you will see it without having to do anything else.  

You can do the transactions from Metamask and authenticate with the ledger.  

## Is eCredits trusted? Does the SCE have my funds? 
The SCE does not have access to your funds. 

eCredits (ECS) are stored on the decentralized eCredits Blockchain. It is a new blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, a proven blockchain technology. 

When you register with the eWallet App for the first time, whether it’s a personal or a business account, you'll be asked to create your Seed Phrase. The Seed Phrase is your security key to the eWallet App consisting of 12 words in a specific order. It is crucial to keep your Seed Phrase secure, so that no one else can access it.  

If you lose it or it gets stolen, you lose access to your eWallet and your funds. The SCE does not know or have access to your Seed Phrase and cannot restore it if lost or forgotten. 

## Do I need to create additional addresses? 
No! You can use one wallet address for everything, but you can also create as many additional addresses as you want to help you better organize your funds. 

## How does the ACT Swap work? 
'ACT' means eActivity, the rewards program for active eCredits users. 

Currently the swap from ACT to ECS (eCredits) is unavailable. Once the swap goes live, we'll inform all eCredits users and instruct them how to use it.

## What's the differences between resetting the Seed Phrase and resetting the password?

Resetting your Seed Phrase requires you to delete your existing eWallet, with its Seed Phrase, from your account. You will get a new wallet and new Seed Phrase. However, any funds you have in your wallet when you reset your wallet will be lost. 

Resetting your password is merely setting a new password for your existing account. During password reset you will retain your wallet and your funds.

## Does buying ECS on Blocktrade trigger a transaction on the blockchain?

Trading on Blocktrade does not create a transaction on the blockchain. Exchanges have a structure of hot and cold wallets, and trading usually only occurs within the exchange and not on blockchain. This is because each transaction on the blockchain would cost gas and would need to be added to the chain. If there are millions of trades they would pollute the blockchain, and as some of them occur within milliseconds, blockchains would be unable catch up. A transaction only happens if you deposit or withdraw. This is how (central) exchanges in general work with all blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
