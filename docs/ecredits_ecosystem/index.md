# Introduction

eCredits (ECS) is the native coin of eSync Network, a pioneering Layer 1 Blockchain, meticulously designed to bridge the gap between the theoretical potential of web3 projects and practical application in the real world.

This documentation is intended to provide an overview of all elements and aspects relating to eSync Network and eCredits (ECS). It is regularly updated and expanded.
You can also find this open source documentation on GitHub under the general eSync Network GitHub account at <https://github.com/esync-network>.

## What is eSync Network

The eSync Network is a public blockchain based on a proven set of technologies, the Ethereum 
protocol, one of the most established open source blockchain protocols. This technology 
has been adopted and extended for this project and provides the perfect foundation for building a 
rapidly-growing ecosystem and can even be optimized further.

The eSync Network has a block-time of five seconds and is fully compatible with Ethereum and 
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Vision

The goal of eSync Network is to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology and real-world assets and make them accessible and beneficial to businesses and communities worldwide.

One of the real world use cases of eSync Network is eCredits.
eCredits is a blockchain-based shopping infrastructure platform offering efficient digital currency solutions, built on the eSync Network Blockchain. eCredits (ECS) is the native coin of the eSync Network Blockchain.

The eCredits Ecosystem is the platform of a movement consisting of local and regional micro-ecosystems 
that create, offer, and sell services and products with the help of the eSync Network. These services 
are aligned to help Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) and establish parity with or even gain an edge 
over larger market players such as international corporations.

The native cryptocurrency of the eSync Network Blockchain is eCredits (ECS). By using ECS, users generate eActivity (ACT), which constitutes a reward system for loyal relationships. Based on such relationships, partners will introduce a variety of additional services including marketing,sales and others.

eCredits seeks to be a currency of value - the people's currency for daily use - by supporting and empowering local economies through neighborly relations and enterpreneurial utility.
